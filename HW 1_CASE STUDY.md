## Business Activities:

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
Large financial firms which have up to $350bn market cap individually, such as Citi, Wells Fargo and JPM.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
Axoni is developing distributed ledger technology for private institutions using their AxCore blockchain.  

## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
Capital Markets trade clearing and settlements.

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?
Almost no innovation within this area for the last 5-10 years.  Banks are still manually reconciling with eachother using emails, excel and phone calls.


* What are the other major companies in this domain?
Other major companies in this domain are Digital Asset and R3. Digital Asset is replacing the Australian Securities Exchanges existing Clearing House Electronic Subregister System (CHESS) with distributed ledger techonology. 


## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
Axoni has already worked with the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) to move its settlements process for derivatives to a distributed ledger technology.  Goldman and Citi have also already cleared the first equity swap using the company's AxCore ledger.

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
Company's in this space are still in the development stage of the technology meaning that they aren't yet profitable.  The best metric would be the number and size of exchanges that the companies are partnered with.  Given the prominence of the DTCC and OCC, Axoni is doing very well based on these metrics.

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
Axoni seems to be succeeding in the US capital markets domain.  Other competitors have broadened their reach to projects either outside of the US or in other industries, such as healthcare, real estate, manufacturing etc.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
To build on what this company is already doing, they could expand their engineering of and capacity to create smart contracts to almost replace banks as a middle man between borrowers and lenders.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
Offering this expansion of their existing product would allow them to grow exponentially and begin to replace large banks as structurers of financial products instead of just working with them to enhance the sharing of data and automate their downstream workflows. 

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
It appears that this company already has the technology to do this with the ability to write applications on top of their AxCore distributed ledger but they haven't made a push to expand this technology.  The Scala programming language for example could write these smart contract applications.

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
A programming language that can write smart contract applications is appropriate beccause you need the infrastructure to build these smart contracts.
